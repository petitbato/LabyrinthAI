# LabyrinthAI

LabyrinthAI is a project focused on developing an artificial intelligence capable of navigating and solving labyrinths. The AI uses a basic BFS algorithm to find the most efficient path through complex mazes.The simple yet reliable and efficient algorithm made me win the 3rd place of the championship !

## Features

- Maze generation
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Visualization of AI solving the maze
- Customizable maze parameters
